                the Blood banks as simple as possible using Structured &amp; Modular technique &amp; Menu oriented
                interface. I have tried to design the software in such a way that user may not have any difficulty in
                using this package &amp; further expansion is possible without much effort. &nbsp;Even though I cannot
                claim that this work to be entirely exhaustive, the main purpose of my exercise is perform each user&rsquo;s
                activity in computerized way rather than manually which is time consuming. People will no longer get
                caught in hospital red tape to procure blood. Detailed information about the blood stock position, blood
                group, blood components and the procedure of getting blood is now available on the Internet. It is Web
                Based Blood Bank Management System.</p>
                <p>&bull;<span class="style10"> Provides the stock of blood for various groups in  the various blood banks.<br/>
  &bull; Provides online registration to people who are  willing to donate blood.<br/>
  &bull; Gives the details of blood donation camps.<br/>
  &bull; GroupWise listing of various blood groups.<br/>
  &bull; Citizens get information about the next coming  blood donation camp via post or email after registration.<br/>
  &bull; Online submission of registration forms.<br/>
  &bull; All the process of submission of registration form  is quite simple.<br/>
  &bull; Department can collect information regarding  various blood groups.<br/>
  &bull; People can get registration by sitting at home.<br/>
  &bull; Before any blood donation camp the registered  citizens gets all the details regarding the camp.</span></p>

                <p><span class="style121">I am confident that this software  package can be readily used by non-programming personal avoiding human handled  chance of error. This project is used by two types of users<br/>
          <em>-&gt; Online  Users. <br/>
          --&gt;Administrator.</em><br/>
      Online users can enquire about the blood donation if he/she  wants to donate or receive blood. Doctors, Nodal Hospitals can also register  through this site.&nbsp;Administrator can  maintain daily updates in the requests of the users, doctors, hospitals etc.  Administrator is must be an authorized user. He can further change the  password. There is the facility for password recovery, logout etc. The main  objectives of the project are:</span>

                <p><span class="style121">I have designed the given proposed  system in <strong>JSP</strong> to automate the  process of Rotary Blood Banks <br/>
The complete set  of rules &amp; procedures related to a blood bank generating report is called <strong>&ldquo;</strong>Rotary Blood Bank Services<strong>&rdquo;.</strong> My project gives a brief idea  regarding automated Blood Bank activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p align="justify" class="style121">The following steps that give the detailed information of the need
                    of proposed system are:</p>
                <p align="justify" class="style121"><strong>Performance:</strong> During past several decades, the
                    company records are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supposed to be manually handled for all the&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    activities. The manual handling of the record is time consuming and highly prone to error. To
                    improve the performance of the blood bank, the computerized system is to be undertaken. The
                    computerized project is fully computerized and user friendly even that any of the members can see
                    the report and status of the blood bank. </p>
                <p align="justify" class="style121"><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The basic need of the project is
                    efficiency. The project should be efficient so that whenever a new customer record is added, or
                    record is modified or deleted, the record is updated automatically. </p>
                <p align="justify" class="style121"><strong>Control:</strong> The complete control of the project is
                    under the hands of authorized person who has the password to access this project and illegal access
                    is not supposed to deal with. All the control is under the administrator and the other members have
                    the rights to just see the records not to change any transaction or entry.</p>
                <p align="justify" class="style121"><strong>Security:</strong> Security is the main criteria for the
                    proposed system. Since illegal access may corrupt the database. So security has to be given in this
                    project. </p>
